# Requirements

* `apt-get install arduino`
* in Arduino IDE install following libraries:
** MIDI Library
** `CD74HC4067`


# Usage

* flash the original firmware for uploading sketches:

```bash
cd sh
./flash_usbserial
```

* flash the midi firmware to make it appear as MIDI device:

```bash
cd sh
./flash_midi
```

# Print settings

* filament:
    * SUNLU PLA+ black (main)
    * SUNLU PLA+ white (labels)

* nozzle temp.: 220 degrees
* build plate temp.: 75 degrees
* wall line count: 3
* top / bottom layers: 3
* infill: gyroid 20%
* print speed: 50mm/s
* infill speed: 75mm/s
* support speed: 75mm/s
* travel speed: 200mm/s
* retraction distance: 8.0mm
* fan speed: 100%
* support pattern: Zig Zag
* support density: 10%
* use adaptive layers: no

* "Pause at height" setting for filament changing:
    * pause layer: last layer before labels
    * method: BQ
    * keep motors engaged
    * park print: yes
    * retraction: 450mm
    * standby temperature: 220 deg.
    * beep at pause
* enable draft shield: yes (to prime extruder after filament change)

# Notes

* let hot bed cool down entirely before attempting to remove print, or otherwise it will warp

# To-do

* build plate needs leveling, right side seems more faint
* when changing to white filament layers, increase nozzle temperature and retraction distance to i.e. 9 or 10mm
    * for black filament, lower to i.e. 6 or 7 mm retraction distance and 220 degrees
* make pot labels font size 1 pixel bigger for better readability
* test and define the way the pieces attach to each other
    * maybe remove screws 5 and 6 again, then print intermediate connector parts
