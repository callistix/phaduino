# Requirements

* `apt-get install arduino`
* in Arduino IDE install following libraries:
** MIDI Library
** `CD74HC4067`


# Usage

* flash the original firmware for uploading sketches:

```bash
cd sh
./flash_usbserial
```

* flash the midi firmware to make it appear as MIDI device:

```bash
cd sh
./flash_midi
```


# Code hierarchy

* Sections (LFO, DCO, ...)
    * Controls (LFO rate, LFO delay, 3 way buttons, ...) (objects are control types, i.e. pot, 3 way switch, 5 way switch)

# BOM

# To-do

* do not retract filament on when printing is paused for filament change, as this seems to drop a blob of material, just move the nozzle out of the way
* text looks messy due to above issue, but maybe increase font size as well to make it more readable, or would a second layer of white filament help maybe?
* add scale labels for reverb pots
* add a way to attach sections to each other with screws
* instantiate object rather than duplicating them
